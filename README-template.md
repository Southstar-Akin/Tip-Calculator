### What I learned
#I have come to realise the tradition learning without practise is about 40% of learning to code
Building this pish me out of my comfort zone as i redeployed to use resources like stack overflow, w3schools and the entire library called Google. I came across concepts like "parseint" in my javascript when i had to convert a string into a number. 
also learned to style the outline of input fields when they were in focus.
It makes me happy to see a problem i couldn't solve yesterday crumble today.
Thanks for growth and continous learning

Also get more skills to boost my input fields
